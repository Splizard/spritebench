The current version is written based on an in-progress branch.
Package imports are expected to be in Odin's shared folder.

Benchmarks were performed by running the following commands to export to a project called TopDown and run from Godot's exectuable.
odin build stress-test/thousands_of_child -build-mode:dll -o:speed  -out:TopDown/bin/libgdexample.dll

C:\\Godot\\Godot_v4.6-release.exe --path ./TopDown
(Or whatever your Path call to Godto is)
